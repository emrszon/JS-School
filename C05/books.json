[{"id":"xHZl0yC8B90C","title":"As You Like It","author":["William Shakespeare"],"publishedDate":"2004-05-31","pageCount":262,"categories":["Drama"],"description":"As You Like It has sometimes seemed a subversive play that exposes the instability of gender roles and traditional values. In other eras it has been prized - or derided - as a reliable celebration of conventional social mores. The play's ability to encompass these extremes tells an interesting story about changing cultural and theatrical practices. This edition provides a detailed history of the play in production, both on stage and on screen. The introduction examines how changing conceptions of gender roles have affected the portrayal of Rosalind, one of Shakespeare's greatest comic heroines. The striking differences between the British tradition and the freer treatment the play has received abroad are discussed, as well as the politics of court versus country. The commentary, printed alongside the New Cambridge Shakespeare edition of the text, draws on primary sources to illuminate how costuming, stage business, design, and directorial choices have shaped the play in performance.","imageLinks":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xHZl0yC8B90C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},{"id":"ESrxBQAAQBAJ","title":"Like, For a Better World - Vol. 2","author":["Medialink Advertising"],"publishedDate":"2014-10-15","categories":["Antiques & Collectibles"],"description":"Like, For a Better World, es una producción de MediaLink Advertising y está dirigida a tomadores de decisiones, Empresarios y Dirigentes y aquellas personas que tenga la capacidad de crear un gran impacto en nuestra sociedad, con un alto y comprobado nivel de altruismo y se sientan comprometidos con ¡Crear un Mundo Mejor!.","imageLinks":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ESrxBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},{"id":"kjDxBQAAQBAJ","title":"Like, For a Better World - Vol. 3","author":["Medialink Advertising"],"publishedDate":"2014-12-15","categories":["Antiques & Collectibles"],"description":"Like, For a Better World, es la Revista Premium de MediaLink Advertising y está dirigida a tomadores de decisiones, Empresarios y Dirigentes y aquellas personas que tenga la capacidad de crear un gran impacto en nuestra sociedad, con un alto y comprobado nivel de altruismo y se sientan comprometidos con ¡Crear un Mundo Mejor!.

A History of Crossed Languages","author":["Juan Francisco Fuentes"],"publishedDate":"2019-04-29","pageCount":462,"categories":["Political Science"],"description":"It is striking that the main political concept coined by the century of democracy has been totalitarianism. Since its birth in fascist Italy in the 1920s, the term has made a long journey throughout different countries and periods. After representing the fascination for dictatorships during the interwar years, totalitarianism became a key concept of the ‘war of words’ waged between democracy and communism until the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was ‘a hot word for a Cold War’, as termed by the author of this book to convey the importance of this contest of crossed languages, which also included images, symbols and other forms of ‘senso-propaganda’. The Closed Society and Its Friendshighlights the role played by language in the building of a dystopian civilization conceived as an alternative to the open society created by liberalism. The book analyses the dimension of totalitarianisms, from fascism and Nazism to communism, as political religions with some common features, such as the cult of personality and the conception of society as a community of believers. This fascinating essay on the dark side of the 20th century ends with a disturbing epilogue: ‘Is totalitarianism back?’","imageLinks":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AeeWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},{"id":"BAtEAAAAcAAJ","title":"The History And Adventures Of The Renowned Don Quixote","publishedDate":"1782","pageCount":580,"imageLinks":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BAtEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},{"id":"NdFpQwKfX2IC","title":"The End of History and the Last Man","author":["Francis Fukuyama"],"publishedDate":"2006-03-01","pageCount":432,"categories":["History"],"averageRating":3,"description":"Enhanced by a new afterword dealing with the post-September 11th world, a provocative exploration of issues of human society and destiny answers such questions as, is there a direction to human history? does history have an end? and where are we now?
