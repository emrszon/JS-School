# Chalenge 04 - Create a piano player

* Use event listener for add sounds of notes in a piano design 
* Build all design with CSS and HTML
* Add listeners for launch all sounds
* Enable click or keyboard events for proper user experience
* Push all the example in your GitHub repo

## Solution

The proposed solution is a piano built in vanilla JS, which is played using the keyboard, mouse or touch.

The piano has 24 keys, a sustain function and a metronome. The sustain function works like a piano pedal, when the note is active, it plays full, if it is not active, the note sounds while the key is pressed

When the metronome is on, play a clap in loop configurable at 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120 or  140 BPM.

Is playable on the keyboard using these keys
