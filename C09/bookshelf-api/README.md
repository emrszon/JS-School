# Challenge 06

Backend endpoints

Generate a backend rest service with the necessary endpoints to use in the application.

Integrate MongoDB to save all reservations
Detailed specs:

- Create some JS code to populate MongoDB with books information.
- Create a method to return all books. This method could receive a QUERY parameter to filter the books by bookShelf: Quito, Medellin, Digital, etcâ€¦.
- Create a method to return the info of 1 book.
- Create a method to lend a Book. This method should validate the book is not lent.
- The backend should Have users.
- Create a login endpoint for a user to authenticate and receive a token
- All the endpoints except Login are secured. Use a JWT approach
- Create a Detailed Readme on how to run the backend

Create at least 3 endpoints to be consumed, use express architecture to mount all services.
